# Software Tools in JavaScript

The best way to learn software design is by example,
and the best examples are the tools that developers use themselves.
This project draws inspiration from
*[500 Lines or Less](http://aosabook.org)*
and the trilogy of books that introduced the Unix philosophy
to an entire generation of programmers:
*The C Programming Language*,
*The Unix Programming Environment*,
and *The Elements of Programming Style*.
