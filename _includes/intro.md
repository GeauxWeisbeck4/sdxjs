The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples <cite>Schon1984,Petre2016</cite>,
and some of the best examples of software design come from
the tools programmers use in their own work.
In these lessons we build small versions of things like file backup systems,
testing frameworks,
regular expression matchers,
and browser layout engines
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
We draw inspiration from <cite>Brown2011,Brown2012,Brown2016</cite>,
[Mary Rose Cook][cook-mary-rose]'s [Gitlet][gitlet],
and the books that introduced the Unix philosophy to an entire generation of programmers
<cite>Kernighan1979,Kernighan1981,Kernighan1983,Kernighan1988</cite>.
