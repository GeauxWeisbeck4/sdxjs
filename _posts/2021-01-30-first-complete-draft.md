title: "First Complete Draft"
---

The first draft of [STJS][stjs-v1] is nearly complete:

1.  All of the example code runs
    (except for one bug in the interaction between unit testing and mock filesystems).

2.  All of the diagrams have been drawn
    and all screenshots of web pages have been converted to SVG and PDF.

3.  The PDF renders correctly,
    though there are still a lot of unfortunate page breaks.

4.  Our [email address][email] is set up if anyone wants to give us feedback.

5.  This blog seems to be working.

Still to do:

1.  Chapter-by-chapter revisions.
    You can help by [sending feedback][email] or [filing issues][stjs-repo].

2.  Fixing that bug.

3.  Re-doing the hand-drawn [concept maps](http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#s:memory-concept-maps)
    as SVGs and adding them to chapters.

4.  Cleaning up those unfortunate page breaks.

5.  Publicizing what we've done so far.
