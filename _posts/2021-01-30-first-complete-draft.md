title: "First Complete Draft"
---

The first complete draft of [STJS][stjs-v1] is nearly complete:

1.  All of the example code runs
    (except for one bug in the interaction between unit testing and mock filesystems).

2.  All of the diagrams have been drawn,
    and all screenshots of web pages have been converted to both SVG and PDF.

3.  The PDF renders correctly,
    though there are still a lot of unfortunate page breaks.

4.  Our [email address][email] is set up if anyone wants to give us feedback.

5.  This blog now seems to be working.
