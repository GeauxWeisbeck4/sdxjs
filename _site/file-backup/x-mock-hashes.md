{% if include.problem %}

1.  Modify the file backup program so that it uses a function called `ourHash` to hash files.
2.  Create a replacement that returns some predictable value, such as the first few characters of the data.
3.  Rewrite the tests to use this function.

How did you modify the main program so that the tests could control which hashing function is used?
