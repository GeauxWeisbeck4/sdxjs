Suppose that `main.js` contains this:

{% include file file='x-refactoring-circularity/main.js' %}

{: .continue}
and `plugin.js` contains this:

{% include file file='x-refactoring-circularity/plugin.js' %}

{: .continue}
Refactor this code so that it works correctly while still using `require` rather than `import`.
