I hope you don't mind mail out of the blue, but I was wondering if you'd be interested in contributing a chapter to a book. Fifteen years ago, *[Beautiful Code][bc]* collected descriptions of elegant software from over thirty well-known programmers. Its four-volume successor, *[The Architecture of Open Source Applications][aosa]*, aimed to teach software design by showing readers how well-known programs were built and why.

We are launching a new project called *[Software Tools in JavaScript][stjs]* to help a new generation of programmers learn how to think about software architecture. Each chapter will present a simplified version of something developers use every day, such as a unit testing framework, a version control system, a module loader, along with a discussion of how it works and why it's built the way it is. All examples will be written in modern JavaScript; all content will be freely available online under the [Hippocratic License][hl]; and all royalties from sales of the book will be donated to [Bridge][bridge], which provides free training and professional development to women, non-binary, and agender tech workers.

If you would like to know more or are interested in contributing, please mail Greg Wilson (gvwilson@third-bit.com).

Hope you and yours are safe and well,
Thanks,
Greg
