We have come a long way since we listed the contents of a directory in <span x="systems-programming"/>.
Saving files in version control,
making sure code meets style rules,
debugging it and bundling it (hopefully in that order)---programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work will help you do them better.

We hope your journey won't stop here.
In particular,
we would like to add more entries describing things like:

-   An accessibility checking tool like <span i="WebAIM WAVE">[WAVE][webaim-wave]</span>
    (which we have used while building this site)?

-   <span g="formal_verification" i="formal verification">Formal verification tools</span>
    like <span i="Alloy; formal verification!Alloy">[Alloy][alloy]</span> <cite>Jackson2016</cite>
    and <span i="TLA+; formal verification!TLA+">[TLA+][tla+]</span> work <cite>Wayne2018</cite>.

-   <span i="code completion">[Intelligent code completion][intelligent-code-completion]</span>.

-   <span i="fuzz testing">[Fuzzing][fuzzing]</span> and
    <span i="delta debugging">[delta debugging][delta-debugging]</span> <cite>Zeller2009</cite>.

-   How relational databases work
    ([this tutorial][db-tutorial] could serve as a starting point).

-   How to create [an HTTP server][500-lines-server] from the socket layer up.

-   A text editor using [termit][termit] or [kilo][kilo] as a starting point.
    (Turns out that "undo" is a lot harder to build than most people realize.)

-   A very simple version of [React][react-tutorials] and <span i="Redux">[Redux][redux]</span>.

-   <span i="OAuth">[OAuth][oauth]</span> for single sign-on.

-   A text-mode browser like [Lynx][lynx].

-   A collaborative text editor like [Etherpad][etherpad]
    (the synchronization algorithm is _hard_).

-   An in-browser testing tool like [Cypress][cypress].

-   A package repository that's resistant to DoS attacks.

-   A distributed logging and monitoring tool.

Contributions of all kinds are therefore welcome;
please see the introduction in <span x="introduction"/>
or the contributors' guide in <span x="contributing"/> for more information.
