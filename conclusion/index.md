We have come a long way since we listed the contents of a directory in <span x="systems-programming"/>.
Saving files in version control,
making sure code meets style rules,
debugging it and bundling it (hopefully in that order)---programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work will help you do them better.

We also hope that your journey won't stop here.
We would really like to have a chapter showing how <span g="formal_verification">formal verification tools</span>
like [Alloy][alloy] and [TLA+][tla+] work <cite>Jackson2016,Wayne2018</cite>,
along with one ones on [intelligent code completion][intelligent-code-completion],
[fuzzing][fuzzing],
[delta debugging][delta-debugging] <cite>Zeller2009</cite>,
and a host of other development tools.

We would also like to create a second volume describing the tools developers use in their applications.
How does a relational database actually work?
[This tutorial][db-tutorial] could serve as a starting point.
What about [an HTTP server][500-lines-server] or [a text editor][termit],
or tools like [Redux][redux],
[web components][web-components],
and [OAuth][oauth]?
How about an accessibility checking tool like [WAVE][webaim-wave]
(which we have used while building this site)?
Building small versions of these would be excellent semester-long projects for undergraduate software engineering classes,
and would help programmers at all stages of their careers.

Contributions of all kinds are therefore welcome,
from errata and minor improvements to entirely new sections and chapters,
and everyone whose work is incorporated will be acknowledged.
If you'd like to join us,
please file an issue or submit a pull request in [our GitHub repository][stjs-repo],
or see the contributors' guide (<span x="contributing"/>) for more information.
