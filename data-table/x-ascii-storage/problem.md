The original ASCII standard specified
a 7-bit <span g="character_encoding">character encoding</span> for letters commonly used in English,
and many data files still only use characters whose numeric codes are in the range 0-127.

1.  Write a function that takes an array of single-letter strings
    and returns an `ArrayBuffer` that stores them using one byte per character
    if all of the characters will fit into 7 bits,
    and multiple bytes per character if any of the characters require more than 7 bits.

2.  Write another function that takes an `ArrayBuffer` generated by the first function
    and re-creates the array of characters.
    The function must *only* take the `ArrayBuffer` as an argument,
    so the first element of the `ArrayBuffer` should indicate
    how to interpret the rest of its contents.

3.  Write tests with Mocha to check that your functions work correctly.
