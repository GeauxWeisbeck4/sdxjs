Modify the comparison of filter and select to work with tables
that contain columns of strings instead of columns of numbers
and see how that changes performance.
For testing,
creating random 4-letter strings using the characters A-Z
and then filter by:

-   an exact match,
-   strings starting with a specific character, and
-   strings that contain a specific character
