<p>We have come a long way since we listed the contents of a directory in <a class="secref" href="../systems-programming/#systems-programming">Chapter&nbsp;2</a>.
Saving files in version control,
making sure code meets style rules,
debugging it and bundling it (hopefully in that order)---programmers do these things every day,
and we hope that understanding how they work will help you do them better.</p>
<p>We also hope that your journey won't stop here.
If you would like to add a chapter to this book
or translate it into another programming language,
human language,
or both,
your help would be very welcome:
please see the introduction in <a class="secref" href="../introduction/#introduction">Chapter&nbsp;1</a>
and the contributors' guide in <a class="secref" href="../contributing/#contributing">Appendix&nbsp;D</a> for more information.</p>
