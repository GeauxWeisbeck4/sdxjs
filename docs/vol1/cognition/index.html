  <h1>Cognition</h1>
<p>As a rough approximation,
human memory can be divided into two distinct layers.
The first,
called <g key="long_term_memory">long-term memory</g>,
is where we store things like our friends' names and our home address.
Its capacity is essentially unlimited,
but it is slow to access.
Evolution has therefore given us a second system
called <g key="short_term_memory">short-term memory</g> or <g key="working_memory">working memory</g>.
It is much faster,
but also much smaller:
<cite>Miller1956</cite> estimated that the average adult's working memory could only hold 7±2 items at a time,
and more recent estimates put the number even lower.
This is why phone numbers are 7 or 8 digits long:
back when phones had dials instead of keypads,
that was the longest string of numbers
most adults could remember for as long as it took the rotor to go around several times.
The size of working memory is sometimes used to explain
why sports teams tend to have about half a dozen members
or are broken into sub-groups like the forwards and backs in rugby.
It is also used to explain why meetings are only productive up to a certain number of participants:
if twenty people try to discuss something,
either three meetings are going on at once
or half a dozen people are talking while everyone else listens.</p>
<p>7±2 is the single most important number in programming.
When someone is trying to write, understand, or fix a line of code,
they need to have many pieces of information in mind:
the current state of the variables,
why execution might be in this branch of an <code>if</code>,
and so on.
If the number of facts needed at any point is greater than the capacity of short-term memory,
the programmer won't be able to keep it all straight.</p>
<p>In order to handle larger sets of information,
our minds create <g key="chunk">chunks</g>.
For example,
most of us remember words as single items rather than as sequences of letters.
Similarly,
the pattern made by five spots on cards or dice is remembered as a whole
rather than as five separate pieces of information.</p>
<p>Experts have more and larger chunks than non-experts,
i.e.,
experts see larger patterns and have more patterns to match things against.
This allows them to reason at a higher level
and to search for information more quickly and more accurately.
However,
chunking can also mislead us if we mis-identify things:
newcomers really can sometimes see things that experts have looked at and missed.</p>
