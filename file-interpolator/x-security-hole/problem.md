1.  Write a function `loadAndRun` that reads a file, evaluates it, and returns the result.

2.  Create a file `trust-me.js` that prints "nothing happening here" when it is evaluated,
    but also deletes everything in the directory called `target`.

3.  Write tests for this using [`mock-fs`][node-mock-fs].
