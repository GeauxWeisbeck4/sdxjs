      A [directed graph](#directed_graph) which does not contain any loops
      (i.e., it is not possible to reach a [node](#node) from itself by
      following edges).

      The priority of an operation. For example, multiplication
      has a higher precedence than addition, so `a+b*c` is read
      as "the sum of `a` with the product of `b` and `c`".

      A [cryptographic hash function](#cryptographic_hash_function) that
      produces a 160-bit output for arbitrary data.  SHA-1 is no longer
      considered strong enough for cryptographic purposes, but is still
      frequently used to calculate keys for [hash tables](#hash_table).

- slug: topological_order
  en:
    term: "topological order"
    def: >
      Any ordering of the [nodes](#node) in a [graph](#graph) that respects the
      direction of its [edges](#edge), i.e., if there is an edge from node A to
      node B, A comes before B in the ordering. There may be many topological
      orderings of a particular graph.

    term: "Coordinated Universal Time"

    def: >
      The standard time against which all others are defined. UTC is the time
      at longitude 0Â°, and is not adjusted for daylight savings.
      [Timestamps](#timestamp) are often reported in UTC so that they will be
      the same no matter what timezone the computer is in.
