    term: "abstract syntax tree"
    acronym: AST
    def: >
      A deeply nested data structure, or [tree](#tree),
      that represents the structure of a program.
      For example, the AST might have a [node](#node) representing a [`while` loop](#while_loop)
      with one [child](#child_tree) representing the loop condition
      and another representing the [loop body](#loop_body).

- slug: dag
  en:
    term: "directed acyclic graph"
    acronym: "DAG"
    def: >
      A [directed graph](#directed_graph) which does not contain any loops
      (i.e., it is not possible to reach a [node](#node) from itself by
      following edges).

- slug: decorator_pattern
  en:
    term: "Decorator pattern"
    def: >
      A [design pattern](#design_pattern) in which a function adds
      additional features to another function or a [class](#class)
      after its initial definition. Decorators are a feature of
      [Python](#python) and can be implemented in most other
      languages as well.

- slug: directed_graph
  en:
    term: "directed graph"
    def: >
      A [graph](#graph) whose [edges](#edge) have directions.

- slug: nested_function
  en:
    term: "nested function"
    def: >
      A function that is defined inside another function.

- slug: sha_1
  en:
    term: "SHA-1"
    def: >
      A [cryptographic hash function](#cryptographic_hash_function) that
      produces a 160-bit output for arbitrary data.  SHA-1 is no longer
      considered strong enough for cryptographic purposes, but is still
      frequently used to calculate keys for [hash tables](#hash_table).

- slug: timestamp
  en:
    term: "timestamp"
    def: >
      A digital record of the instant at which something occurred.
      Timestamps are usually recorded in [UTC](#utc).

- slug: topological_order
  en:
    term: "topological order"
    def: >
      Any ordering of the [nodes](#node) in a [graph](#graph) that respects the
      direction of its [edges](#edge), i.e., if there is an edge from node A to
      node B, A comes before B in the ordering. There may be many topological
      orderings of a particular graph.

- slug: utc
  en:
    term: "Coordinated Universal Time"
    acronym: "UTC"
    def: >
      The standard time against which all others are defined. UTC is the time
      at longitude 0Â°, and is not adjusted for daylight savings.
      [Timestamps](#timestamp) are often reported in UTC so that they will be
      the same no matter what timezone the computer is in.
