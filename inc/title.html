      Good programming is not learned from generalities,
      but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean,
      easy to read,
      easy to maintain and modify,
      human-engineered,
      efficient,
      and reliable,
      by the application of common sense and good programming practices.
      Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing.
