1.  Modify the wrapping and rendering so that
    if a block of text is too wide for the available space
    the extra characters are clipped.
    For example,
    if a column of width 5 contains a line "unfittable",
    only "unfit" appears.

2.  Extend your solution to break lines on spaces as needed
    in order to avoid clipping.
