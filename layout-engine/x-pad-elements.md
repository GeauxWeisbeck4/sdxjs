{% if include.problem %}

Modify the existing code so that:

1.  Authors can define a `padding` attribute for row and column elements.

2.  When the node is rendered, that many blank spaces are added on all four sides of the contents.

{: .continue}
For example, the HTML `<row>text</row>` would render as:

```txt
+------+
|      |
| text |
|      |
+------+
```

{: .continue}
where the lines show the outer border of the rendering.
