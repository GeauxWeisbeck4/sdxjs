{% if include.problem %}

Some packages release new versions on a regular cycle,
e.g.,
Version 2021.1 is released on March 1 of 2021,
Version 2021.2 is released on September 1 of that year,
version 2022.1 is released on March 1 of the following year,
and so on.

2.  How does it make it more difficult?
