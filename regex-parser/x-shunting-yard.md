1.  Use the [shunting-yard algorithm][shunting-yard-algorithm]
    to implement a tokenizer for a simple subset of arithmetic that includes:

    -   single-letter variable names
    -   single-digit numbers
    -   the `+`, `*`, and `^` operators, where `+` has the lowest precedence and `^` has the highest

2.  Write Mocha tests for your tokenizer.
