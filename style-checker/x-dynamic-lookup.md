{% if include.problem %}

1.  Write a function `dynamicExecution` that takes an object,
    the name of a method,
    and zero or more parameters as arguments
    and calls that method on that object:

    ```js
    dynamicExecution(obj, 'meth', 1, 'a')
    // same as obj.meth(1, 'a')
    ```

2.  What *doesn't* this work for?
