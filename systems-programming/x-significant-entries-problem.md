`count-lines-histogram.js` displays many zeroes and gives no visual sense of how large entries are.
Modify it so that:

1.  When it is run with the `--nonzero` flag only non-zero values are shown.

2.  When it is run with the `--graphical` flag the numeric values are replaced with rows of asterisks.

3.  If both flags are given the program prints an error message instead of running.
