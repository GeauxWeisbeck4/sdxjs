The best way to learn design in any field is to study examples,
and some of the best examples of software design come from
the tools programmers use in their own work.
In these lessons we build small versions of things like file backup systems,
testing frameworks,
regular expression matchers,
and browser layout engines
both to demystify them
and to give some insights into how experienced programmers think.
We draw inspiration from <cite>Brown2011,Brown2012,Brown2016</cite>,
[Mary Rose Cook][cook-mary-rose]'s [Gitlet][gitlet],
and the trilogy of books that introduced the Unix philosophy to an entire generation of programmers
<cite>Kernighan1979,Kernighan1988,Kernighan1983</cite>.

## Who is our audience?

Every lesson should be written with specific learners in mind.
These three [personas][t3-personas] are ours:

-   AÃ¯sha started writing VB macros for Excel in an accounting course and never looked back.
    She has spent the last three years doing front-end JavaScript work
    and now wants to learn how to build back-end applications.
    This material will fill in some gaps in her programming knowledge
    and teach her some common design patterns.

-   Rupinder is studying computer science degree at college.
    He has learned more about the theory of algorithms than about building software,
    and while he uses Git and unit testing tools on a daily basis,
    he doesn't feel he understands how they work.
    This material will give him a better understanding of those tools
    and of how to design some of his own.

-   Yim builds mobile apps for a living
    but also teaches two courses at Rupinder's college:
    one on full-stack web development using JavaScript and [Node][nodejs] (which they are quite proud of),
    and another titled "Software Design".
    They are frustrated that so many books about the latter talk about the subject in the abstract
    and use examples that their students can't relate to.
    This material will fill those gaps
    and give them starting points for a wide variety of course assignments.

Like these three personas, readers should:

-   Know how to write JavaScript programs using loops, arrays, functions, objects, and classes.

-   Know how to create static web pages using HTML and CSS.

-   Be able to install [Node][nodejs] on their computer
    and run programs with it from the Unix or Windows command line.

-   Use [Git][git] to save and share files.
    (It's OK not to know [the more obscure commands][git-man-page-generator].)

-   Be able to explain what a tree is and how to visit the nodes in one recursively.
    (These are the most complicated data structure and algorithm we *don't* explain.)

## What tools do we cover?

Programmers have invented [a lot of tools][programming-tools] to make their lives easier.
This volume focuses on a few that individual developers use while writing software;
we hope that [the second volume][stjs-v2]
will explore those used in the applications that programmers build.

## What ideas do we cover?

The glossary in <x key="gloss"></x> defines the terms we introduce in these lessons.
Together, these define the scope of our lessons:

-   How to turn a program into a data structure that can be processed like any other.

-   How we can process a program like any other piece of text.

-   How programs are executed and how we can control and inspect their execution.

-   What design patterns are and which ones are used most often.

-   How we can analyze programs' performance in order to make sensible design tradeoffs.

-   How to find and run pieces of code when we don't know in advance that they exist.

## How are these lessons laid out?

We display JavaScript source code like this:

```js
for (const thing in collection) {
  console.log(thing)
}
```

::: continue
and Unix shell commands like this:
:::

```sh
for filename in *.dat
do
    cut -d , -f 10 $filename
done
```

::: continue
Data and output are shown in italics:
:::

```txt
Package,Releases
0,1
0-0,0
0-0-1,1
00print-lol,2
00smalinux,0
01changer,0
```

We occasionally wrap lines in source code in unnatural ways to make listings fit the printed page.
Where we need to break lines of output for the same reason,
we end all but the last line with a single backslash `\`.
We also sometimes use `...` to show where lines have been omitted to shorten listings.
The full listings are all available in [this project's Git repository][stjs-repo]
and [on our website][stjs-v1].

Finally,
we write functions as `functionName` rather than `functionName()`;
the latter is more common,
but people don't use `objectName{}` for objects or `arrayName[]` for arrays,
and the empty parentheses makes it impossible to tell
whether we're talking about "the function itself" or "a call to the function with no parameters",
which is confusing when we're passing functions as arguments.

## How did we get here?

In the early 2000s,
the University of Toronto asked [Greg Wilson][wilson-greg]
to teach an undergraduate course on software architecture.
After delivering the course three times he told the university they should cancel it
because of a lack of useful material:
between them,
the dozen textbooks he had purchased with the phrase "software architecture" in their titles
devoted a total of less than 30 pages to describing the designs of actual systems.

Frustrated by that,
he and Andy Oram persuaded some well-known programmers to contribute a chapter each
to a collection called *Beautiful Code* <cite>Oram2007</cite>,
which went on to win the Jolt Award in 2007.
Entries in the book described everything from figuring out whether three points are on a line
to core components of Linux
and the software for the Mars Rover,
but the breadth that made them fun to read
also meant they weren't particularly useful for teaching.

To fix that,
Greg Wilson, Amy Brown, Tavish Armstrong, and Mike DiBernardo
edited a four-book series between 2011 and 2016 called *[The Architecture of Open Source Applications][aosa]*.
In the first two volumes,
the creators of 50 open source projects described their systems' designs;
the third book explored the performance of those systems,
while in the fourth and final volume,
contributors built scale models of common tools
as a way of demonstrating how those tools worked.
These books were closer to what an instructor would need for an undergraduate class on software design,
but still not quite right:
the intended audience would probably not be familiar with many of the problem domains,
and since each author used the programming language of their choice,
much of the code would be hard to understand.

*Software Tools in JavaScript* is meant to address these shortcomings:
all of the code is written in one language,
and the examples are all tools that programmers use daily.
Most of the programs are less than 60 lines long and the longest is just over 300;
we believe each chapter can be covered in class in 1-2 hours,
while the exercises range in difficulty from a few minutes to a couple of days.
